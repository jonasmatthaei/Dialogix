# How to

## Streamlit as possible frontend

Inside the "streamlit" folder you find Python code snippets to help you develop a frontend for your hackathon project with streamlit.

## Getting Started inside the "streamlit" folder

1. **Install Streamlit**: If you haven't already, install Streamlit and additional packages using pip:
    ```python
    pip install streamlit pillow plotly
    ```

3. **Develop your frontend**: Use the provided Python code snippets as a starting point to develop your frontend. Streamlit allows you to quickly create interactive web applications with Python. You can create interactive widgets, display data in tables and charts, and more.

4. **Run your Streamlit app**: Once you've developed your frontend, you can run your Streamlit app with the following command:
    ```python
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```
    The Home.py file is defining the first page of the frontend. In the pages folder you find multiple other pages for streamlit which can be activated by selecting those pages on the left side.

## Deployment

Each hackathon group gets a VM with port 8501 opened to the internet. You can use this port for deploying your Streamlit frontend. When you run your Streamlit app, it will be accessible at `<VM-IP>:8501` by default. You can share this URL for presenting your final hackathon results.
